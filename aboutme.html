            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>At my core, I am a person who finds joy in helping others. I am a geek with a big heart. I am a Marine Corps veteran who became a social worker who became a data analyst, 
                    who is moving into software engineering. I find meaning in my life by making a difference in other's lives and by being a positive influence in this world. 
                    I get energized by solving those problems that everyone said couldn't be solved. I get excited about things like process improvement and efficiency. I am not afraid to use Google. 
                    I like to dive into manuals, StackOverflow, and any other resource at my disposal to find the answers I need. I am an introvert that works well with others,
                    has strong communication and presentation skills, and has many different interests and passions from which to draw new ideas and solutions.</p>
            <h2>Software Engineering Experience</h2>
            <p>I am a self-taught programmer who is about to start a coding bootcamp to further enhance my job readiness and programming skillset.</p>
            <p>I started in middle school building computers, but for some reason shied away from programming at that time. I guess I was more excited about LAN parties,
            new video games, and hardware. However, after a career-detour-and-life-experience-enhancer called the military, and college, I found myself doing a freelance
            job that required knowing some JavaScript to add functionality to PDF forms. In learning the skills that I needed to complete the work, I found myself in a 
            new world I found incredibly interesting. It sparked the beginnings of a career transition which led me to MOHAI (the Museum of History &amp; Industry), where
            I am the Data Manager &amp; Analyst. Meanwhile, I have been taking courses through the University of Washington, MITx, and Harvardx, along with the usual
            assortment of learning through places such as Treehouse and Codeacademy.</p>
